This is a fork of Alexduro's MWE enhancements mod ([https://github.com/Alexdoru/MegaWallsEnhancements](url)) which extends its functionality:
* The Squad HUD now includes a direction and distance indicator for squad members. The distance is seperated into vertical and horizontal distance, both calculated using the manhattan method.
* A mega walls "enhancement" has been added to automatically heal nearby squad members when certain conditions are met and the player is using the phoenix class.
